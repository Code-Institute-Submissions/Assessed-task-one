            <div class="disclaimer">
                For the sake of content, I have only used a small number of the total teams that entered and competed in the international. If I was to use every team, it would produce an excessively busy site.
            </div>
            <div>
                <div class="question"><u>What is the international?</u></div>
                <div class="answer">The dota 2 international is a global E-sports compition to determin the best team of the year. It takes place over 5 days typically in late august and consists of 18 teams. Each team will be rewarded with a cash prize even if they come
                    lest place, simply getting into the tornment alone shows enough for a share of the fortune. Hoested by valve (the owners of steam and many other ground breaking games, for example cs.go) so the money isnt short, this allows the event
                    to be displayed incredibly in exotic locations with lare seatign areas for the public, incredible faciilitys and to make it genrally apealing and profesional for both the public and the players. This most recent international is the
                    8th so far which explains how it can be called ti8 (the international 8).</div>
                <div class="question"><u>How long has dota been around?</u></div>
                <div class="answer">Dota itself actually originated from a mod on World of warcraft (a mod stands for a modification, developing your own game inside of another effictivly). This was back in 2003 when modding on world of warcraft was huge, dota (defence of
                    the ancient) kicked off so well that valve recognised this and even though it was originally on a blizzard game created it for themselves which released in 2013, blizzard tried to contest this as they assumed they would have rights
                    as the game was bassed of of their assests but they were incorrect. Many companies have been making MOBA's (multiplayer online battle arean) since. </div>
                <div class="question"><u>How popular is this game?</u></div>
                <div class="answer">Incredibly, in 2016 they were easily hitting over a million peak amount of players every month. This type of popularity makes the funding for the international and other smaller compitiions that much easier. Comparign recent years however,
                    like in august of 2018 they had a peak of 830,000 and 880,000 the year before however even though the number of players is slightly dropping, the community funding has never been stronger leavign some to rightfully argue that dota
                    2 has one of the most commited and strongest fan base out there.</div>

                <div><u>How do they get this money?</u></div>
                <div>This fact that pros have collectively won more playing Dota 2 than they have in League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, StarCraft II, and Counter-Strike 1.6 combined. The money itself comes simply from crowdfunding from an
                    in-game app called 'the compendium' which gives the user unique rewards.</div>
