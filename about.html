                    <div class="answer">The dota 2 international is a global E-sports compition to determin the best team of the year. The main few matches ranging across 10 days typically in late august and consists of 18 teams. Each team will be rewarded with a cash prize
                        even if they come lest place, simply getting into the tornment alone shows enough for a share of the fortune. Hoested by valve (the owners of steam and many other ground breaking games, for example cs.go) so the money isnt short,
                        this allows the event to be displayed incredibly in exotic locations with lare seatign areas for the public, incredible faciilitys and to make it genrally apealing and profesional for both the public and the players. This most
                        recent international is the 8th so far which explains how it can be called ti8 (the international 8).</div>

                    <div class="answer">Dota itself actually originated from a mod on World of warcraft (a mod stands for a modification, developing your own game inside of another effictivly). This was back in 2003 when modding on world of warcraft was huge, dota (defence
                        of the ancient) kicked off so well that valve recognised this and even though it was originally on a blizzard game created it for themselves which released in 2013, blizzard tried to contest this as they assumed they would have
                        rights as the game was bassed of of their assests but they were incorrect. Many companies have been making MOBA's (multiplayer online battle arean) since. </div>

                        <div class="answer">Incredibly, in 2016 they were easily hitting over a million peak amount of players every month. This type of popularity makes the funding for the international and other smaller compitiions that much easier. Comparign recent years
                            however, like in august of 2018 they had a peak of 830,000 and 880,000 the year before however even though the number of players is slightly dropping, the community funding has never been stronger leavign some to rightfully
                            argue that dota 2 has one of the most commited and strongest fan base out there.</div>

                    <div class="answer">The competitive sceane in dota 2 is one of the biggest in e-sports, this is clear for multiple reasons. The first is if you were to go onto twitch (the hub for streamers which tend to also be professional e-sport players) then you
                        would see an entire catagory dedicated to dota 2. This is statisticaly shown and supports its growth, the peak veiwers in 2015 was 56k, in 2016 was 626k and in 2018 was 842k. According to reliable sites it is the 7th most watched
                        game on the site as of september 2018. There is also always tornments going on, whether they are small with no/ a small prize all the way to profesional games with impressive prizes which proves that the demand for this games competitive

                    <div class="answer">Some players always seem to outdo themselves when theyre in the spotlight and pull of plays poeple diddnt know they were capable of. The main player people were impresed by was OG's 'ana' who had come from teams that had never even
                        made a LAN before so there was the question of will the preasure be to much for him especiall as he was to take on the roll as carry but carrying is exactly what he did with heros like kunkka, ember spirit and spectre. Another
                        player that impressed was PSG.LGD's Fy who is nicknamed as a God but is still yet to win the international but with such a close final this year he my have been closer than ever. Improving over the years playing an impressive rubik,
                        earthshaker and the occational sandking he really helped his team get to where they unded up in 2018 international.</div>
