                <div class="modal-body">
                    The grand final of ti8, this was a best of five fight and all five fights were played.<br><b>Game 1- (OG)</b><br>The first game LGD were holding the early game, getting first blood and their carry getting picks so OG were playing defensive
                    but as soon as LGD would get too confident OG would flip it around and counter it with aggresion allowing them to get a few good picks on ganks however while OG lost the lanes they still managed to get a fair trade in team fights.
                    It all flipped around when the shut down spectre got an ultra kill for OG at a rosh fight allowing them to secure rosh and push upperground which LGD could not defend as team fights were not going there way, after upperground got pushed
                    LGD could not defend it and called GG at 34 mins.<br><br><b>Game 2- (PSG.LGD)</b><br>The second game took a diffrent turn as it was compleatly dominated LGD, they get first blood and from the point the game goes in their way. They
                    eliminate OG's courier early on which greatly impacted OG as they could'nt get any items. Enchantress had the top net worth in the game at 11 mins which lead to a good start allowing them to control the map and secure rosh at 26 mins
                    and also managed to turn a losing fight allowing them to hold a huge mental advantage over OG and have a 5k gold advantage. At this point the game was so in LGD's favour as their two supports kill OG's gyro carry. At this point LDG
                    push racks and OG called GG at 38 mins.<br><br><b>Game 3- (PSG.LGD)<br></b>The third game of the five intense matches was extremely agressive, OG perform a perfect play with lina sniping the courier mid before the game was to start
                    putting LGD at an instant disadvantage however after getting the first two kills of the game top and bot the gold was instantly in their favour and even though they had no courier and couldnt get their items they still managed to win
                    the early game playign very agressivly however the first big fight was still won by OG despite this Fy (LGD's captin) clutched a great play as him as pheonix was fighting a 3v1 and managed to kill two of them before dying meaning he
                    could get to a higher level and making his supernova even harder to kill. By 20 mins there had been a total of 42 kills meaning with all these kills that the game could swing any way but as OG's supports have a total of 26 deaths its
                    in the favour of LGD. After LGD feeding off of OG's supports they manage to push upperground causing OG to call gg at 34 mins.<br><br><b>Game 4- (OG)</b><br>The longest game out of the 4 where OG secure first blood but PSG instantly
                    trade it and get an aditional kill on top of it. LGD ganking mid but OG's mid managing to kill 2 while dying but after that OG's mid (invoker) seems to get shut down fairly heavily but after a while of this invoker was able to come
                    back. OG were doing a fantasic job of shutting down LGD's cores and carries which allows them to continue to play agressive which is exactly what they did and giving them map control and this allowed them to push uppground at the early
                    of time of 26 mins. Invoker was managing to rat dota bot but only does some tier three damage. At this point LGD manage to get a few solid picks and push heavily forcing buy backs from OG as they begin to lose axe a lot but Phanton
                    lancer and I.O do an incredible job defending and winning the fight and pushing which kept repeating untill rosh was taken by OG giving them the advantage they needed to push and force the GG from LGD.<br><br><b>Game 5- (OG)</b><br>The
                    final match of the internaition, so already the preasure is on and the hype is real for the players and the spectators, from the people at home to the ones in the stadium but however was one of the more simple games, it started with
                    LGD gettign first blood and Fy as earth shaker getting ganks all over the map putting LGD's network migh above OG's, with this happening for a while by the 18 min mark OG were losing 18-4 on kills as they were also losing team fights.
                    It all changed around rosh... In one big team fight where it diddnt look promising for OG but after a few buy backs on their side this long fight came to an end in OG's favour allowing them to take rosh. This was the confidence boost
                    that OG needed as from this point the game was theirs, they stopped loosing team fights and instead began to dominate and snowball and an incredible rate, so much so they went from having the lower team net worth to a net worth advantage
                    of 21k in under 8 mins. One big last team fight settled it all as LGD could not keep up with this pace, when wiped it it allowed OG to push for the win at 36 mins and become the international 2018 champions!

                    The losers stage of ti8, this battle was a best of three.<br><b>Game 1- (PSG.LGD)</b><br>EG started this well with first blood and both teams carries seemed to be getting taken out quite a lot. Venomancer and IO relocated to top lane
                    and got a huge tripple kill but it get equils out as soon after LGD wins a huge fight and as a result puts the gold advantage slightly in their favour. This meant that the team could take control of the game and they followed it up
                    with a large team wipe and continue to shut down EG's Alchemist and get several picks giving them an 8k gold advantage so they could play aggresivly. EG lose a fight at rosh meaning LGD get the aegis which allow LGD to team fight again
                    and push for the win as EG called gg at 42 mins.<br><br><b>Game 2- (PSG.LGD)</b><br>For a game so close to the end of ti8 it was intrestingly quiet, first blood was diffrent as Rubik kills Luna. Unfortunatly for Luna she contiues to get
                    ganked for a lot of the early game for LGD however OG's spectre is also being shut down so the disadvantage is balanced. LGD's wraith king played by Chalice and snowballs heavily throwing the advantage in LGD's favour. LGD perform
                    a beautiful team wipe with zero casualties which allows them to push and win for the early 32 min game, not allowing the late game to prevent the spectre for becoming a problem.

                    The winners stage of ti8, these matches were a best of 3.<br><b>Game 1- (OG)</b><br>The first game of the three, first blood went to OG. There was quite a lot of early game picks coming from both teams meaning the net worth of the
                    game was a lot higher than average. OG playing with aggresive pushing which is going their way as they are getting kills and a few towers, LGD retaliate to this as bouncing back as OG dive and LGD switch it around winning the fight
                    and follow this with a rosh fight allowing them to gain come confidence and get a few strong picks but start to fall off as LGD are failing to pull of their combinations which allows space for OG to grab the advantage, take rosh again
                    and increase that gold advantage and this is a big thanks to gyrocopters and IO's synergy which they follow up with a push and get two sets of racks in one push. Due to their advantage they are able to push again and take that final
                    set of racks and force a gg from LGD.<br><br><b>Game 2- (PSG.LGD)</b><br>LGD getting first blood on offlane winning all the offlane fights and continuing to kill OG's carry.Fight slowly sway into OG's favour but this does not last long
                    as LGD bring it back and teamwipe even though OG had taken rosh and take racks and whithin 5 mins push for the win at 37 mins.<br><br><b>Game 3- (OG)</b><br>The final fight of this stage, the nerves are there as whoever wins this is goign
                    to the finals. OG lost the early game as LGD get the first blood on spectre and repeatedly ganked mid and win the first big fight with clockworks cogs paying off greatly picking off a lot of kills with them. OG are struggling to defend
                    from the picks meaning the deaths for OG are high but OG managed to win a team fight using their teams stun with Earthshaker. They follow this advantage with winning a rosh fight and getting the aegis but begin to struggle even with
                    this and start to lose fight and the gold gap starts to close. LGD begin to push for tier threes and do some damage, follow it up with a rosh push and dominate to the point where they are pushing OG's base and start doing damage to
                    the ancient but somehow OG defend this and retaliate with a heavy push and with a lot of help from Topsons's Arc warden they manage to recover and push for the win at 58 mins.

                    The semi final of ti8, this stand off was a best of three fight.<br><b>Game 1- (EG)</b><br>This game started relitivly even with Liquid getting the first blood but EG quickly trading it back but Liquid manage to secure the mid lane
                    winning it early game and considering EG had the gold advantage this was a huge bonus for Liquid however around 15 mins into the game weaver start to get a few major pick offs giving him farm and allowing EG to win the first big team
                    fight throwing the gold advantage further their way even further plus this fight alowed EG to stop Liquids rosh. At this point EG get confident with their advantage and try to push the upper ground but this does not go their way at
                    all and they lose three heros and take no towers in the process allowing Liquid to take rosh for themselves, things after this are quiet for a while with a few fights here and there and this is where Chaos Knight buys a divine rapier
                    which is potentially the move that could have made them win the game but in this case potentially the move that may have lost it for them, not long after this purchase ursa got his hands on it. After this the game only went in one
                    direction, they get megas and force a GG at a long 1h 4mins with their strong 51k gold advantage.<br><br><b>Game 2- (EG)</b><br>This game was heavily one sided as soon as things kick off, EG got first blood and both teams were getting
                    some even picks and the game could have gone either way. Liquid were trying to play aggresivly but this blew up in their faces as their agression got taken advantage of and EG used it to win the first big team fight, Liquid had to
                    buy back several times this game to try and contest the game but it wasnt enough as this game was mostly one sided. Liquid losing a large fight and buying back to defend but dying again meaning EG have all the time in the world to
                    push but they are not waisting time as they go straight for the finish and for a gg out of Liquid at 34 mins.

                    The second quarter final of ti8, a best of three battle.<br><b>Game 1- (Liquid)</b><br>This was an intresting game as both teams were playing extremely well, Liquid getting first blood on Alchemist but being traded by Secret instantly
                    after this Alch begins to get a few picks helping his farm snowball but this was matched but Liquid getting a few extra kills in the team fights giving them that small gold lead which when a game is this close helps a huge amount.
                    Rosh is taken by both teams during the game meaning both teams have the advantage. Secret managed to pull of a team wipe with no deaths on their half meaning they could do some tower damage and gain some push, this diddnt do too much
                    for Secret however as Liquid managed to pick off the carries and win some hugh fights alowing them to push for racks. One more big fight down the line and they were able to push for megas forcing Secret to call gg making it a 51 min
                    game.
                    <br><br><b>Game 2- (Liquid)</b><br>This game is very straight forward, Liquid secure two kills on their first blood and get lots of early game picks however as do Secret but Liquid just seem to get more and as a result win all of the team
                    fights and dont allow Secret to get any farm. This is what the game consists of and Liquid take rosh at 40 mins allowing them to continue picking off Secret's supports meaning they can push and win at 42 mins.

                    The first quarter final of ti8, a best of three battle.<br><b>Game 1- (EG)</b><br>EG getting first blood on VP's support boosting that gold lead in their direction. The kill trades continue for majority of the game rosh is then taken
                    at the 30 min mark byt EG throwing the game into their direction letting them dominate leaving VP struggling for kills so one big team fight allowed EG to push and win in only 5 mins from rosh finishing the game at 35 mins.<br><br><b>Game 2- (EG)</b><br>This
                    game led VP contesting more and fightly for their place in the international, EG lost first blood on their carry helping Liquid winning bottom lane. Liquid continue to shut down this alch as two supports manage to take him down but
                    somehow EG still manage to win the first big team fight letting their carry get a tripple kill rebounding from this early shut down. Liquid win teams fights also making this game much more even up until about 30 mins where Liquid begin
                    to lose their carrys in fights meaning that EG can push after these fights and get some tower damage in. Rosh was got by EG which meant they could push heavily and as they were pushing they won another team fight which allowed them
                    to push and win knocking VP out of the international in a 46 min game.
